# Dividend-Analysis

In this project, we would like to analysis a dividend data set.

The features in this data set include:

Dividend: 0 for dividend; 1 for no dividend
Fcfps (Free cash flow per share $): Useful to gauge the return a shareholder 
                                    receives after buying a stock.
                                    
Earnings Growth (year %): Change in an entity’s reported net income.

Debt to Equity Ratio: Measure of the extent to which a company covers its debt. 

Market Cap: Measure worthiness of a company in stock market.

Current Ratio: Measures company’s ability to pay its short-term obligation.


OBJECTIVE:
Our objective is to find a good model to classify whether a stock pays dividend
or not.

Methods:
We will be using PCA and LDA methods to see if these will give us a good model 
for prediction. 

Group Members:
Ravish Kamath, Vi Nguyen, George Zhu & Yutong Pan

THERE IS A POSTER TO VIEW ALL THE RESULTS IN THIS REPOSITORY.
